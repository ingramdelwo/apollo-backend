## What You Can Do in Offline Mode
 
Playing Starcraft 2 offline will allow you to:

- Play all Campaign and Challenge missions. You can choose from Wings of Liberty, Heart of the Swarm, Legacy of the Void, and Nova Covert Ops campaigns, depending on which ones you own. You can also replay any mission you have completed before.
- Play Custom Games vs. the AI. You can create your own custom games with any map and settings you want, and play against computer-controlled opponents. You can adjust the difficulty and behavior of the AI to suit your skill level and preference.
- Play Any Battle.net Arcade maps you have previously played (or can otherwise be found on your computer). The Arcade is a collection of user-created maps and modes that offer different gameplay experiences. You can play any Arcade map that you have downloaded or played online before, as long as it is stored on your computer.

## What You Cannot Do in Offline Mode
 
Playing Starcraft 2 offline will not allow you to:

- Earn Achievements. Achievements are rewards for completing certain objectives or challenges in the game. They are only tracked and awarded when you are online.
- Earn Experience for your Starcraft 2 profile. Experience is earned by playing any mode in the game, and it unlocks new portraits, decals, skins, and other cosmetic items for your profile. Experience is only accumulated and applied when you are online.
- Play LAN games, or otherwise invite anyone else into custom games. LAN games are local multiplayer games that do not require an internet connection. However, Starcraft 2 does not support LAN mode, so you cannot play with other people on your local network or invite them into your custom games.
- Battle.net social features. Battle.net social features include chat, friends list, groups, clans, and voice communication. These features are only available when you are online.

## Why Play Starcraft 2 Offline?
 
You might wonder why anyone would want to play Starcraft 2 offline when there are so many benefits and features that are only available online. Here are some possible reasons:

- You have a slow or unreliable internet connection. Playing online can be frustrating if your connection is laggy or drops frequently. Playing offline can provide a smoother and more stable gameplay experience.
- You want to practice or learn the game without pressure. Playing online can be intimidating or stressful if you are new to the game or facing skilled opponents. Playing offline can help you improve your skills and knowledge at your own pace and without fear of losing or being judged.
- You want to enjoy the story or explore the maps without distractions. Playing online can be distracting or annoying if you have to deal with chat messages, friend requests, notifications, or other interruptions. Playing offline can help you immerse yourself in the game's rich story 8cf37b1e13
